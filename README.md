# Final_Year_Project

This is the CAD files with the flight configuration parameters for the mechatronics engineering final year project on the "Analysis, Design, and Development of a Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with Bioinspired Shape Morphing Deployable Wings." The project is completed by Junbang Liang and William A'court under the supervision of Dr Minas Liarokapis.

The proposed UAV is based on a traditional quadrotor drone with a pair of morphing wings to transform the vehicle into a tailsitter configuration. The structure of the wings takes inspiration from a bird√¢s wing, where the main skeleton is made from three links, with the feathers replaced with frames covered by PET film. In addition, the wings are fully tendon driven with many degrees of freedom coupled with string pulleys. The final design is a quadrotor UAV platform that weighs 2.6 kg, with a wing attachment weighing 3 kg spanning 2.16 m. By morphing the wing, the UAV achieves a contraction ratio of 49% of the extended wing span. The design is experimentally validated through a series of tests. It is found that i) the wing consumes insignificant power compared to the UAV motors, i) the feather morphing shows small variation, iii) wing deployment has an insignificant effect on vehicle stability, iv) the wing structure is robust to crashes, v) contracting the wing improves UAV roll and yaw controls.
